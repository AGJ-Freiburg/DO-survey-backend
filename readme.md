# MEGAPART - BACKEND
Germany-wide survey designed to understand the digital needs of homeless people. The survey was accessible at www.umfrage.daten-oase.org. The evaluation can be found at: [evaluation]( https://github.com/AGJ-Freiburg/megapart_evaluation). This repository contains the backend code of the survey. This survey was developed within the context of the EU project *"Cloud for homeless people"* of the [AGJ-Fachverband Freiburg](https://agj-freiburg.de). To guarantee it's usefulness, the survey was designed directly by AGJ-FREIBURG in collaboration with homeless people and social workers.
